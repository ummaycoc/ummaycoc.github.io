# The Life and Times of Matthew Maycock

## Projects
- [Lazy Moist Yeast](https://www.LazyMoistYeast.com/)  
  _My mid-2000s era style photoblog._

## Musings
- [Beating C with Dyalog APL: wc](https://ummaycoc.github.io/wc.apl/)  
  _Inspired by [Beating C With 80 Lines Of Haskell: Wc](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/wc)._

## Readings
- [Biodiversity In Dead Wood](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/biodiversity-in-dead-wood/32EA8DA79A503B95795384FFA5BC993D)  
  _A Tour de Force of (at least Finnoscandian) saproxylic species and their place in the world._
- [Myxomycetes](https://www.elsevier.com/books/myxomycetes/alvarado/978-0-12-805089-7)  
  _My current read: explore the wonderful world of slime molds. Teaser: there's something afoot within their mitochondria!_
- [FUNGI Magazine](http://fungimag.com)  
  _Easily my favourite periodical. Provides lots of great references for further reading (it's where I found out about Biodiversity in Dead Wood), deeply researched articles, and many pieces of an accessible nature._
- [Measure and Integration](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/measure-and-integration)  
  _Probably my favourite mathematical text. Berberian writes wonderfully and has a great sense of humor._
- [God: A Human History](http://rezaaslan.com/book/god-a-human-history/)  
  _An interesting analytical view at the development of religion covering various hypotheses on its genesis and evolution._
